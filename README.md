Client selection is critical for determining the performance of FL. Most existing client selection methods aim to maximize the number of selected clients who can upload their local models before the deadline, in each global iteration, thereby potentially accelerating the model convergence rate. However, these methods ignore the fact that most IoT devices are powered by embedded batteries and collect green energy from the environment to extend battery life. Therefore, clients selected using these methods may not have sufficient energy to upload their local models to a global iteration or may not be able to participate in the training process in the near future due to battery depletion. The implementation offers a customer selection method, named GREED, to optimize the balance between maximizing the number of selected customers and minimizing the energy drawn from the batteries for the selected customers, while ensuring that all selected customers have sufficient energy to upload their local models before the deadline.
